# Dummy text
txt = &quot;Sukanya, Rajib and Naba are my good friends. &quot; \
&quot;Sukanya is getting married next year. &quot; \
&quot;Marriage is a big step in oneâ€™s life.&quot; \
&quot;It is both exciting and frightening. &quot; \
&quot;But friendship is a sacred bond between people.&quot; \
&quot;It is a special kind of love between us. &quot; \
&quot;Many of you must have tried searching for a friend &quot;\
&quot;but never found the right one.&quot;

# tagger or POS-tagger.
